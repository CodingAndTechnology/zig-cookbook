[Zig cookbook](https://zigcc.github.io/zig-cookbook/) is a collection of simple Zig programs that demonstrate good practices to accomplish common programming tasks.

# How to run

Each recipe is accompanied by an illustrative example named after its corresponding sequence number. These examples can be executed using the command `zig build run-{chapter-num}-{sequence-num}`, or `zig build run-all` to execute all.

> Currently Zig 0.11.0 is required to run those examples.
